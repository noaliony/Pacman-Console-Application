This is the format of the files.

Steps files:
1. The first line will say whether the game is with/without colors.
2. The rest of the lines will say "Index:Direction":
3. Every index represents a different entity in the game:
0-Pacman
1-Fruit
and indexes 2-5 represent Ghosts.
4. The letters represent the directions the entities will go:
A-Left
W-Up
D-Right
S-Stay
X-Down
5. When a fruit appears it will say "1 S X Y VALUE" - the direction is stay,
and then it will say the X,Y location of the fruit, and the value of its digit.
6. When a fruit disappears it will say "fruit die".

Result file:
1. When Pacman wins the screen it will say "win: <point in time>"
2. When Pacman dies to a ghost it will say "lose: <point in time>"
3. The point in time is the current game iteration in which the event happened.
